        <h2>What is the 50/30/20 Rule?</h2>
        <p>
            The 50/30/20 rule is a budgeting method that divides your income into three key categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>50% Needs:</strong> Essential expenses that you can’t live without. These include things like rent or mortgage payments, groceries, utilities, transportation, and insurance.</li>
            <li><strong>30% Wants:</strong> Non-essential expenses that enhance your lifestyle. This category includes dining out, entertainment, shopping, and vacations.</li>
            <li><strong>20% Savings/Debt:</strong> Financial priorities that ensure your future stability. This category covers emergency savings, retirement contributions, and paying off debt.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The beauty of the 50/30/20 rule is its simplicity and flexibility, making it an ideal budgeting strategy for various income levels and financial situations.
